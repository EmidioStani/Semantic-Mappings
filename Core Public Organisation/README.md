# Core Public Organisation Semantic Mappings

This folder contains all the mappings created as outcome of the alignment process of Core Public Organisation with other specifications such as Schema.org.

Mappings are currently provided as a spreadsheet, so they can be consulted as a tabular format, and as RDF.

For more information on the process, please see the [README](../README.md)
